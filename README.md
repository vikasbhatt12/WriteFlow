To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18 or later)
* A MongoDB Atlas account or a local MongoDB instance.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone your-github-repo-link-here.git
    cd your-project-folder
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `/server` directory and add the following variables:
    ```env
    PORT=5001
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_string_for_jwt
    ```
    Then, run the server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

3.  **Setup the Frontend:**
    In a new terminal, navigate to the client directory:
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```
